  <p class="text-lg mt-4 text-slate-600">
    In the past few years I have helped entrepreneurs and investers build
    innovative and sustainable businesses by identifying financial resources, by
    scouting investment opportunities and by managing portfolio companies. I
    strongly believe in constant education and in transitioning to a digital,
    sustainable, and lean way of working.
